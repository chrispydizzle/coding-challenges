# coding-challenges
Just a collection of classes I've made while solving coding challenges on the various code comp sites.
All in C#.

Most recently focused on solving LeetCode problems from the Facebook collection: https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/facebook/

May also focus here: https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-facebook-questions/

Typically I try to write all of the code in a non-IDE setting (ie: what leetcode provides). 

Once I get the test to pass I create a new class in my IDE and drop the code in.

More than happy to answer any questions about my code-
